#   Please use the SimpleConfig unless you know what you are doing and      #
#   need functionality that the SimpleConfig doesn't provide.               #
#   This is basically the same as an advanced config but uses Autorank's    #
#   limits to reach the ultimate goal you want. There is no special file    #
#   called super advanced config, because this is just the advanced config  #
#   used in a "harder" way. Be careful, you might cry trying to set this up #
#                                                                           #
